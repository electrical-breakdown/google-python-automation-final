##A collection of automation scripts that were part of the final project for the Coursera Google IT Automation with Python course. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This project consisted of creating several different scripts that would be used to parse a collection of text tiles and images, format the info, upload it to a Django back end, and send an email containing a PDF summary of the data that was uploaded.

There was an additional script that would run health checks on the server and send an email alert if any of the checks failed.
