## Google IT Automation With Python Final Project

### A collection of automation scripts that were part of the final project for the Coursera Google IT Automation with Python course. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This project consisted of creating several different scripts that would be used to parse a collection of text tiles and images, format the info, upload it to a Django back end, and send an email containing a PDF summary of the data that was uploaded.

There was an additional script that would run health checks on the server and send an email alert if any of the checks failed. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I still have a lot to learn, but I was able to complete each task with the desired functionality. It wasn't called for by the project, but I saved the parsed data into a JSON so I could easily access it in the other scripts and not have to parse it again.
